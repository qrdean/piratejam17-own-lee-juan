## Automation Gameplay

~The ability to place objects on the ground~ basics handled
~~Have a resource entity, with a position and collision we can detect~~

~~The ability to click context menus that allow you to do things~~

~~Have workers that transport these items between places. Need pathfinding between two points.~~

### Worker instructions
Workers can have instructions. 
old??
Click building. Has a number of output worker slots (more outputs gives more slots)
Buildings outputs can connect to another building, creating a path
e.g. Building a has output x Building b has input x click (a) -> select output x connect building b.

Worker has an receive and dropoff building selection. Set these via the context menu and it will build a path between the two

Have a transform entity that allows the user to select a recipe to transform the item into something else
Collector Box. Ships off to somewhere else

Grid System

(might not do this could be too much)
- The resource has to be "transformed" literally in 3D space in-order for it to be accepted into certain machines
- Lets say we have cubes or something, we slice the cube in half. Then have to rotate the cube in place for it to do something.

## Art Design Themes?
