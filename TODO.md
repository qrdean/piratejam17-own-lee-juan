~The ability to place objects on the ground~ basics handled
~~Have a resource entity, with a position and collision we can detect~~

Have workers that transport these items between places. Need pathfinding between two points.

Grid System
Have a transform entity that allows the user to select a recipe to transform the item into something else
Collector Box. Ships off to somewhere else

(might not do this could be too much)
- The resource has to be "transformed" literally in 3D space in-order for it to be accepted into certain machines
- Lets say we have cubes or something, we slice the cube in half. Then have to rotate the cube in place for it to do something.
