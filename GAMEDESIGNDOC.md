- Only have one type of resource to work with. You are trying to make that resource into a bunch of things. So kinda like an automation kinda thing
    - Want to produce only one product. But have a limited amount of resources of different types.
- Have one kind of resource to trade with. And you need to trade with others to get stuff
- Fighting game/beatemup with one option/button
