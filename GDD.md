#### Ideas

- Only have one type of resource to work with. You are trying to make that resource into a bunch of things. So kinda like an automation kinda thing
    - Want to produce only one product. But have a limited amount of resources of different types.

### Inspirations
My smelly cat
Satisfactory
Star Craft

### Mechanics
'Mining' from one resource you transport it into another resource.
The puzzle comes from handling the routing of said resources and trading them off.

'Workers' pick up the items from a resource chain and send it off there can only be X number of workers per chain/only pick one at a time 
'Workers' can pick up the output of a transform and go to another transform or drop off zone.
Once you hit a milestone you unlock another set of recipes to use

Some resources are used to build buildings
There is a set number of workers.

Goal is to get a working boat to get off the island with all your cats

### Theme
Island Theme
Could be you were with a plane with a 1000's of cats. 
When you crashed you have a bunch of cats and cat food lying around.
Using the crashed parts you are able to automate the usage of cat food to create different items
Use all these parts to build a boat to get home 

E.g.
From catfood you crush up the cat food to create sand.
From catfood you feed it to the cats and concrete

Food -> Cat -> Litterbox -> Fuel

Catfood -> Open -> Food + Catfood can('metal')
Can -> machine -> Ingot
Ingot -> machine -> Iron Plates
Ingot -> machine -> Wires

Concrete -> machine -> Foundation(?)
Catfood + Concrete -> brick
Catfood + Water -> 
Concrete -> blocks
